The rationale and assumptions for various techniques will be presented and practice given in applying them to data using statistical software packages. Assumed Background: No background in statistics or mathematics is assumed. Link to Electronic Course Profile (ECP) Course Introduction This course will examine and apply basic statistical methods used in quantitative research in second language acquisition, applied linguistics and linguistics. The focus will be on quantitative methodology used in language research in applied linguistics and related fields, but the course will be of interest to anyone who wants a better understanding of quantitative methods in language research. The course has three main aims. It will provide grounding in the basic logic and scope of quantitative reasoning (= statistics) in language research exposure to the statistical techniques commonly used in-depth experience in using and reporting statistical results using R and RStudio. Statistical methodology in language research is very broad and has different levels of sophistication. The course will endeavor to introduce the conceptual underpinnings, analytical methods and technical tools you need to understand quantitative findings in the research literature and potentially use these techniques in your own research.

This amounts to 10 online study tasks. The questions will be about the content of the lecture and the required reading(s) for that week. Each online study task is worth 3% of your final grade. You only have 60 minutes and a single attempt to finish each weekly online study task. The link to the online study tasks for each week will be made available on Blackboard. Annotated Bibliography Task Description Weight: 30% Due date: Wednesday of week 10 Submission: via TurnItIn Annotated Bibliography The purpose of this assignment is to give you experience in reading, understanding, and critically evaluating reports of statistical analyses. You should select 3 research articles in your area of interest that contain and report statistical analyses. Please choose the articles very carefully (i.e., from reputable peer-reviewed journals), as the credibility of your selected sources will be assessed. For each article, in a separate entry, answer the following questions: What research question(s) and hypotheses did the article attempt to answer? Identify the research question(s) and, where relevant, any hypotheses tested. What data was used to answer the research question(s) and hypotheses? Describe the source, type, and size of the data and the variables it represented. The description of the data can be in prose or tabular format. Cite the source of the data if relevant and provide information about whether the data is accessible to other researchers (including yourself). What methodology was used? Identify the statistical methods used to address the research question(s): What tools/techniques/procedures were used? What were the findings? Briefly state the results of the study. Were the research question(s) addressed? Were the hypotheses rejected or substantiated? What are potential issues of the analysis? Evaluate the study’s methodology: where all relevant factors considered? Were the data and the methodology described in sufficient detail? Were any suggestions made on how to mitigate the limitations? Each entry should be no longer than 300 words. Your summaries should be presented clearly, coherently, ad precise. Bibliographic details for each article should be presented at the beginning of each entry in APA 7 citation style. After completing the 3 entries write a short (400 words) comparison of your evaluation of the analyses in the 3 articles analysed. Some style notes: Number your entries. The article should be cited at the beginning of each entry using APA 7 format. Use double spacing and a 12-point font. Follow APA format for formatting your document. Use 2.5cm margin in both sides and top and bottom. Always aim to paraphrase and use your own words – try not to cite verbatim but synthesize information. Write the number of words at the end of your assignment. Please refer to the rubic (available via the ECP) for details. If you are sick/absent, see Section 5.3 Late submission. Research Project Task Description Weight: 40% Due date: Monday two weeks after the end of week 13 (Nov. 7, 2022, 4pm) Submission: via TurnItIn The Research Project assessment is worth 40% of your final grade. Below you will find the weighting of each individual component of this assessment as well as some additional information about the marking criteria. The relevant rubrics are also attached for your reference. Research Project Your Research Project is marked out of 40 points following the marking criteria in the rubic available via the ECP. Write an R Notebook (Rmd) containing a research project report of no longer than 3000 words (excluding references) which states a research question, poses a hypothesis, describes and visualizes the data that you use to answer the research question, details the statistical analysis of the data, and provides a critical evaluation of the analysis. The R Notebook containing the research project report as well as a rendered docx or pdf of the R Notebook need to be submitted by the Friday two weeks after the end of week 13, 4pm (Nov. 11, 2022), via Turnitin. Purpose To undertake in-depth research project of a specific topic in the language sciences (it may be connected to the literature review you have already undertaken for your Annotated Bibliography assessment) and to practically apply the conceptual knowledge and the methods which were presented in this course to a data set that you have to find yourself. Your task is to write a research report consisting of the following sections: Introduction: This section should briefly introduce the topic of your research project and clearly state the research question and hypothesis. Data: This section should provide information about the data collection or the data source and describe, tabulate, and visualize the data that you use to answer your research question. The description and tabulation of the data should provide the descriptive statistics to summarize the nature and parameters of the data. Methodology: This section should describe and justify the statistical method(s) that you use to answer your research question. Statistical Analysis: This section shows how you implemented the statistical method. Conclusion: This section should provide a summary of the finding of the analysis, show how or if the research question has been answered, state if the hypothesis was rejected or substantiated, and provide a critical evaluation of the analysis and its limitations. Please refer to the rubic (available via the ECP) for details. If you are sick/absent, see Section 5.3 Late submission.

Extensions can be requested for assessment items such as: oral assessment for individuals or groups essays assignments case studies laboratory reports take-home essays tutorial group assignments Applications to request an extension of assessment due date must be submitted through my.UQ, on or before the assessment item’s due date and time. A request for an extension of the assessment due date must be accompanied by supporting documentation that is truthful, accurate, describes in detail why an extension is required, and demonstrates the impact of the circumstances on a student’s academic performance to justify the entire period they were affected. Requests for extensions received after the assessment item submission due date and time must include evidence of the reasons for the late request. In the case of a group assessment item, an extension approved for an individual does not apply to the whole group. The following penalties apply to late or non-submission of an assessment item: * A penalty of 10% of the maximum possible mark allocated for the assessment item, or one grade per day if graded on the basis of 1-7, or equivalent penalty if a different grading approach is used, will be deducted for every day for up to 7 calendar days, at which point any submission will not receive any marks.
